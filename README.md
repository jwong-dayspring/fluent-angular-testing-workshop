# Fluent Conf 2017 Workshop: Turbocharged Testing With Angular

You've been tasked to deliver a high-quality, well-tested dashboard to track The Grid's most prominent hackers! We will be learning all about unit testing Angular apps.

![app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/app-screenshot.png)

## Setup

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

### Tools Needed
  * Git
  * Node (at least 6.10)
  * npm (at least 3.10)
  * latest Google Chrome
  * latest Google Chrome Canary (important!)
  * GitHub account
  * Visual Studio Code editor

### Configure Project
You will need to do the following:
  * fork this repo to your GitHub account
  * clone your fork locally
  * Globally install the Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`
  * inside `fluent-angular-testing-workshop`, install dependencies: `npm install`

### Verify

The following commands should work:

`npm start`: should open your browser and display the app we will be working with:

![app start](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/app-screenshot.png)

`npm test`: should yield output similar to this (no errors):

![test start](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/npm-test-initial.png)

### Create branch

`git checkout -b solution`

We will be working on a new branch and working through the modules. In the last module, we will be opening a pull request and using TravisCI to run our builds.

### Exercises and Solution
The empty exercise files you'll be completing end in `*.spec.ts`. The solutions are right next to the file, which are named `*.specx.ts`. If you to switch between running your specs vs. the solution, in `src/app.test.ts`, change the regex for the specs to:

```js
const context = require.context('./', true, /\.specx\.ts$/);
```

## Module 1: Unit Testing With Jasmine

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

### Why test?

The [Angular Testing Guide](https://angular.io/guide/testing) puts it very clearly:
  * Unit tests guard against breaking existing code (“regressions”) when we make changes.
  * Unit tetss clarify what the code does (use as documentation).
  * They reveal mistakes in design and implementation. Tests force us to look at our code from many angles and also make your code more modular.

### Jasmine
  * A BDD framework for JS code
  * standalone, no DOM required
  * Clean syntax: describe, it, expect
  * Others: Mocha, QUnit, Jest (Facebook)
  * Often used with a mocking library like Sinon

### Sample Module

```js
const SuperAwesomeModule = {
  featureA: () => {
    ...
  },
  featureB: () => {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Suites
  * test suite begins with "describe"
  * takes a string (spec suite title) and a function (block of code being tested)
  * suites can be nested

```js
describe('SuperAwesomeModule', () => {
  describe('featureA', () => {

  });

  describe('featureB', () => {

  });
});
```

### Specs
  * call global Jasmine function `it(<string>, <fn>)`
  * a spec contains one or more expectations
  * expectation: an assertion that is either true or false.
  * spec with all true expectations: pass
  * spec with one or more false expectations: fail

```js
describe('SuperAwesomeModule', () => {
  describe('featureA', () => {
    it('should calculate some super awesome calculation', () => {
        ...
    });

    it('should also do this correctly', () => {
        ...
    });
  });
});
```

### Expectations and Matchers
  * call global Jasmine function `expect(<actual>).<matcher(expectedValue)>`
  * a matcher implements boolean comparison between the actual value and the expected value

```js
describe('SuperAwesomeModule', () => {
  describe('featureA', () => {
    it('should calculate some super awesome calculation', () => {
        expect(SuperAwesomeModule.featureA([1, 2, 4]).toEqual(7);
    });

    it('should also do this correctly', () => {
        expect(SuperAwesomeModule.featureB('...').toBe(true);
    });
  });
});
```

### Included Matchers
```js
expect(foo).toBe(true); // uses JS strict equality
expect(foo).not.toBe(true);
expect(foo).toEqual(482); // uses deep equality, recursive search through objects
expect(foo).toBeDefined();
expect(foo).not.toBeDefined();
expect(foo).toBeUndefined();
expect(foo).toBeTruthy(); // boolean cast testing
expect(foo).toBeFalsy();
expect(foo).toContain('student'); // find item in array
expect(e).toBeLessThan(pi);
expect(pi).toBeGreaterThan(e);
expect(a).toBeCloseTo(b, 2); // a to be close to b by 2 decimal points
```

### Included Matchers: Exceptions
```js
expect(() => {
  foo(1, '2')
}).toThrowError();

expect(() => {
  foo(1, '2')
}).toThrow(new Error('Invalid parameter type.')
```

### Setup and Teardown
```js
describe('ApiService', function() {
  const serviceInTest;

  beforeEach(function() {
    serviceInTest = new ApiService();
  });

  afterEach(function() {
   ...
  });

  it('retrieves data', function() {
    ...
  });

  it('updates data', function() {
    ...
  });
});
```


### Disabling suites/specs
```js
describe('SuperAwesomeModule', () => {
  xdescribe('featureA', () => {
    it('should ...', () => {

    });

    it('should ...', () => {

    });
  });

  describe('featureB', () => {
    xit('should ...', () => {

    });

    it('should ...', () => {

    });
  });
});
```

### Spies
  * test double functions called spies.
  * can stub any function and tracks calls to it and all arguments.
  * A spy only exists in the describe or it block in which it is defined, and will be removed after each spec.
```js
describe('SuperAwesomeModule', function() {
  beforeEach(function() {
    // track all calls to SuperAwesomeModule.asyncHelperFunction()
    // and return a mock response
    spyOn(SuperAwesomeModule, 'asyncHelperFunction').and.returnValue(Promise.resolve(mockData))
  });

  describe('featureA', function() {
    it('should ...', function() {
      expect(SuperAwesomeModule.featureA(x)).toBe(y);

      // matchers for spies
      expect(SuperAwesomeModule.asyncHelperFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
```


### Asynchronous support
  * spec will not start until the done function is called in the call to beforeEach
  * spec will not complete until its done is called.
  * Default timeout is 5 seconds, can override: jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL

```js
describe('long asynchronous specs', function() {
  beforeEach(function(done) {
    done();
  }, 1000);

  it('takes a long time', function(done) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      done();
    }, 9000);
  }, 10000);

  afterEach(function(done) {
    done();
  }, 1000);
});
```

### Tasks

We will test drive the implementation of a `scoreCalculator` function (sums up scores) that satisfies the following:
  * `should work with one number`
  * `should work with more than one score`
  * `should treat negative scores as 0`
  * `should return zero with empty input`
</details>

## Module 2: Configuring Terminal Reporting

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Inside the Angular project, running `ng test --single-run --code-coverage` will output something like this:

![terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-07%20at%202.57.12%20PM.png)

It's a bit difficult to know which tests exactly ran, so let's configure our terminal spec reporting. To do so, you will need to install the `karma-spec-reporter` plugin and configure `karma.conf.js`. It should already be included when you ran the initial `npm install`.

**Tasks**:

  * in the `plugins`, require the `karma-spec-reporter`: `require('karma-spec-reporter')`
  * in the `reporters`, replace `'progress'` with `'spec'`
  * in the `reports` array inside the `coverageIstanbulReporter` object, add `'text-summary'`

Now, when you run your tests, you should get something like this:

![terminal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-08%20at%2011.34.09%20AM.png)

</details>

## Module 3: Basic Component Testing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `src/app/core/menu`

In this module, we will learn the basic steps in setting up unit tests using the Angular testing utilities. There are [3 standard methods of testing Angular components](https://vsavkin.com/three-ways-to-test-angular-2-components-dcea8e90bd8d):

  * **Isolated** tests: we treat the component class as vanilla JS. Don't render the component.
  * **Shallow** tests: use the Angular testing utilities to render the component, but don't render children components.
  * **Integration** tests: **not** end-to-end tests here. In this method we render children components also.

When testing components, we will be using the **shallow** method of testing components, and when our components take in inputs, and/or we want to test outputs, we will use a test host component.

#### Basic Setup

We first need to import a few of the testing utilities, and also the component to test:

```js
import { async, ComponentFixture, TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { MenuComponent } from './menu.component';
```

We start our describe block, and before each of our tests, we want to configure the testing module. In the declarations property is where you declare the component being tested. We first compile the components in test:

```js
let component: MenuComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<MenuComponent>;

beforeEach(async(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [ MenuComponent ]
  })
  .compileComponents();
}));
```

`compileComponents()` will ensure that external templates and styles are inlined. This is an async operation, so we use the `async` utility, which runs it in a special *async test zone*. If you're using webpack, this isn't needed, but it's a good idea to always have this here in case your build system changes.

We then get handles on two important pieces:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MenuComponent);
  component = fixture.componentInstance;
  fixture.detectChanges();
});
```

* fixture : A fixture for debugging and testing a component. Provides access to the component instance and also the `DebugElement`, a handle on the component's DOM element.
* component : The component instance

`fixture.detectChanges()` initializes the component (calling `ngOnInit()`) and runs the change detection cycle.

With setup out of the way, we can start writing assertions. For instance, a test to ensure that two menu items get rendered:

```js
it('should render two menu items', () => {
  const menuItems = fixture.debugElement.queryAll(By.css('a'));
  expect(menuItems.length).toBe(2);
});
```

We use the `debugElement`'s `queryAll` method to retrieve all `DebugElements` that satisfy the search, and using the `By.css` utitlity.

Running this, you will get an error:

`Can't bind to 'routerLink' since it isn't a known property of 'a'`.

Since we aren't importing the module for routing, Angular doesn't recognize this directive. However, we want to **shallow** test, so we will tell Angular to ignore components and directives not included in the `declarations` property by using the `NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA` constant:

```js
import { NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
```

and declare a new `schemas` property when confiuring the test module:

```js
schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA]
```

### Tasks

Write a spec `'should render a different hacker link title'`.
  * change the component's `hackerLink` property to something else
  * trigger a change detection cycle
  * Use the `debugElement` and the `By` utiltity to assert that the new title is reflected in the DOM.

***hint***: Once you obtain the `debugElement` reference to the hacker link, you can get the native `HTMLElement` through the `nativeElement` property.

</details>

## Module 4: Testing Components with I/O and Change Detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `src/app/status`

In this module, we will learn how to test components with inputs and outputs. The best way to test this kind of components is by using a *test host component*. Essentially, in your test you create a parent component which houses the component you want to test. This way, it's very easy to feed it inputs, and to listen for any output events.

We will be looking at the `StatusComponent`, which has the following behavior:

![status component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/status-component.gif)

This is how it is used:

```html
<app-status [status]="hacker.status" (newStatus)="updateStatus($event)"></app-status>
```

It takes in as input a `status` which can be `'danger'`, `'safe'`, or `'warning'`. It also exposes a `newStatus` event, and whenever fired, it will call the specified function with the new message. If we take a look at the `StatusComponent` class and template, the `newStatus` event will get emitted when the status component is clicked on.

```html
<div class="status-pulse" (click)="refreshStatus()">
  <span class="pulse" [ngClass]="color"></span>
  <span class="dot" [ngClass]="color"></span>
</div>
```

With this knowledge, let's create a test host component:

```js
@Component({
  template: '<app-status [status]="appStatus" (newStatus)="updateStatus($event)"></app-status>'
})
class TestHostComponent {
  appStatus: string;
  updateStatus = jasmine.createSpy('statusSpy');
}
```

For the `TestBed` configuration, we will include both the `StatusComponent` and the `TestHostComponent` in the declarations. We then obtain a fixture on the test host component, and the test host component instance. Do not call `fixture.detectChanges` here since that will trigger the `ngOnInit` method.

```js
let testHost: TestHostComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<TestHostComponent>;

beforeEach(async(() => {
  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    declarations: [ StatusComponent, TestHostComponent ]
  })
  .compileComponents();
}));

beforeEach(() => {
  fixture = TestBed.createComponent(TestHostComponent);
  testHost = fixture.componentInstance;
});
```

With the setup out of the way, we are now ready to write some tests.

### Tasks:

Complete the following tests:
  * `should set pulse color to green when input is "safe"`
  * `should set pulse color to yellow when input is "warning"`
  * `should set pulse color to red when input is "danger"`
  * `should set pulse color to green when input is undefined`
  * `should output a new message when clicked`

For the first four tests, you want to follow these steps:
  * Arrange: set the `appStatus` property on the test host component to what you are currently testing, so something like `'safe'`
  * Act: trigger a change detection cycle (`fixture.detectChanges()`), and get a reference to the element with class of `.pulse`. Use the `fixture.debugElement.query()` utility, and `By.css()`. This would look something like `fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('.pulse')).nativeElement`
  * Assert: You can then assert things about the `classList` property of the element.

For the last test:
  * Arrange: get a reference to the main container with class `.status-pulse`
  * Act: simulate a `click()`
  * Assert: the `testHost.updateStatus` function/spy should have been called. You can also assert things about the argument.
</details>

## Module 5: Testing Components with (Async) Service dependencies

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Reference**: [Test a component with an async service](https://angular.io/guide/testing#test-a-component-with-an-async-service)

**Code**: `src/app/hacker-list`

In this module, we will learn how to test components with (async) service dependencies. When performing such tests, we must specify the injected services in the `providers` property when configuring the testing module:

```js
TestBed.configureTestingModule({
  declarations: [ HackerListComponent ],
  providers: [
    { provide: ApiService, useValue: mockApiService },
    { provide: Router, useValue: mockRouter }
  ],
  schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA]
})
```

Here we are using the `provide` object literal, such that when the DI system retrieves the `ApiService`, it will use the provided value. Here we don't provide the real service, but instead a mock service. The `mockApiService` should simply be an object that has the same interface as the actual `ApiService`:

```js
const mockApiService = {
  getHackers: () => { }
};
```

This component only utilizes the `navigate` method of the router, so we can also create a mock for that.

```js
const mockRouter = {
  navigate: () => { }
};
```

At the top of the describe block, in addition to declaring variables for the `component` and `fixture`,we also want to declare a variable to hold a reference to the injected service:

```js
let component: HackerListComponent;
let fixture: ComponentFixture<HackerListComponent>;
let api: ApiService;
```

How do we get the injected service? The best way to do so is to get it from the component's injector:

```js
api = fixture.debugElement.injector.get(ApiService);
```

From here on, we can spy on `api`, and not the `mockApiService`. It is simply a clone of that object.

### Testing Async

Suppose one of your components method performs async work:

```js
ngOnInit() {
  this.api.getProducts()
    .then((data: any) => {
      this.products = data;
    });
}
```

In your test, you should first spy on the service mock and return a controlled response:

```js
spyOn(api, 'getProducts').and.returnValue(Promise.resolve(mockProducts));
```

Then, there are two methods of testing this:
  * use `async` and `fixture.whenStable`
  * use `fakeAsync` and `tick`

The first is to use the `async` testing utility, which is a function that returns a function, which becomes the second argument to the `it` call. You must then uses the fixture's `whenStable` method which returns a promise when all async work within this test is complete.

```js
it('...', async(() => {
  spyOn(api, 'getProducts').and.returnValue(Promise.resolve(mockProducts));

  component.ngOnInit();

  fixture.whenStable()
    .then(() => {
      expect(...).toEqual(...);
    });
}));
```

The second method is to use the `fakeAsync` testing utility. It allows you to write a test in a more linear fashion:

```js
it('...', fakeAsync(() => {
  spyOn(api, 'getProducts').and.returnValue(Promise.resolve(mockProducts));

  component.ngOnInit();

  flush(); // "flushes" asynchronous tasks

  expect(...).toEqual(...);
}));
```

If you need fine time control, the `tick` function simulates the passage of time, and it can take in an optional argument of milliseconds.

### Tasks
Write tests for the `initial display` (`describe` block)
  * `makes a call to api.getHackers`
  * `sets initial data (using async)`: Since `ngOnInit` performs async work, we use the `async` testing utility
  * `sets initial data (using fakeAsync)'`: use `fakeAsync` instead. You will need to use the `tick` function here

Write a test for the `click on hacker` (`describe` block):
  * `should navigate to the hacker/:id path`

**Relevant imports**:
```js
import { async, ComponentFixture, TestBed, fakeAsync, flush } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { HackerListComponent } from './hacker-list.component';
import { NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
import { ApiService } from '../core/services/api.service';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import { By } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { mockHackers } from '../core/helpers.spec';
```

</details>

## Module 6: Testing Services

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `src/app/core/services`

When it comes to testing services in Angular, you could write *isolated* tests (no Angular testing utilities) or *shallow* tests (using Angular utilities like the `TestBed` and the `inject` function). I recommend writing isolated tests for services, as they are essentially just a class, as adding in the Angular helping utilities will probably just add complexity to your tests. If your service depends on other services, you can easily stub them out.

Here is our basic `ApiService`:

```js
@Injectable()
export class ApiService {

  baseUrl = '/api';

  constructor(public http: Http) { }

  getHackers() {
    return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}/hackers`)
      .toPromise()
      .then((res: Response) => res.json());
  }

  getHackerDetails(id: string) {
    return this.http.get(`${this.baseUrl}/hackers/${id}`)
      .toPromise()
      .then((res: Response) => res.json());
  }
}
```

When testing services, at the top of your describe block, you will need to declare the a variable that will hold the reference to your service, and create spies for any dependencies.

```js
let service: ApiService;
const httpSpy = jasmine.createSpyObj('http', ['get']);
```

Using the `createSpyObj` method gives us great flexibility as we can instruct it to return different values as needed. Unit tests should isolated, fast, and should not make external http requests, which is why we will stub out the `Http` service instead.

Before each spec, create a brand new instance of the service:

```js
beforeEach(() => {
  service = new ApiService(httpSpy);
});
```

Now for each spec, the structure will look like this:

```js
it('...', (done) => {
  // create a mock response

  // instruct any dependent service to return the mock response
  // by using the spy object

  // make the call to your service

  // if the call is async (returns a Promise), you can listen
  // for when the problem resolves, assert, and then call done()
});
```

Note here that we are using the Jasmine built-in done function. This suffices for our unit tests, and there really is no need to bring in the `async` or `fakeAsync` utilities. In fact, when dealing with Observables, you will have to use the `done` function instead.

### Tasks
Write the following unit tests for both the `getHackers` and `getHackerDetails` of the `ApiService`.
  * `getHackers`: `'should return list of hackers'`: You should assert that `http.get` gets called with `'/api/hackers'`, and the data returned is the mock data.
  * `getHackerDetails`: `'should return hacker details given hacker id'`: You should assert that `http.get` gets called with `'/api/hackers/${id}''`, and the data returned is the mock data.

</details>

## Module 7: Testing Directives

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `src/app/core/directives`

An attribute directive is used to modify behavior of an existing element or component. Suppose we have a directive that can be added to an input element to prevent numeric input. We can easily achieve this using a `@HostListener` and listening for the `keydown` event.

```js
import { Directive, HostListener, ElementRef } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appNonNumeric]'
})
export class NonNumericDirective {

  constructor(private element: ElementRef) { }

  @HostListener('keydown', ['$event'])
  onKeydown(event) {
    const numberRegex = /[0-9]/;

    if (numberRegex.test(event.key)) {
      event.preventDefault();
    }
  }

}

```

And its usage:

```html
<input appNonNumeric type="text" placeholder="Search...">
````

Looking at the implementation, you could very well write an isolated test and test the `onKeydown` method. However, we want to test how this directive will make other elements behave. We will be using a test host component along with the Angular testing utitlies.

A test host component can look like this:

```js
@Component({
  template: `<input appNonNumeric type="text"/>
             <textarea appNonNumeric></textarea>`
})
class TestHostComponent {
}
```

When testing this, we can use the `debugElement` and `By` to query for the input. `DebugElement`s have a useful `triggerEventHandler` that you can call. In this case, we would trigger the `keydown` event.

### Tasks:
Complete the following tests:
  * `should allow regular text input`: You should query for the `input` element, and trigger the `keydown` event handler. Create a mock event, and call `input.triggerEventHandler('keydown', event)`.
  * `should not allow numeric text input for input elements`: Similar setup to the first one, except the event's key property should be a string containing a number
  * `should allow regular text input for textarea elements`
  * `should not allow numeric text input for textarea elements`

</details>

## Module 8: Testing Pipes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `app/core/pipes`

In this module we will learn how to test pipes. Testing pipes in Angular is actually very easy, there is really no set up as we are writing vanilla jasmine tests, without any Angular testing utilities. You should write these kind of isolated tests for both services and pipes.

Suppose we have a pipe to transform any string input to all uppercase letters:

```js
import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from '@angular/core';

@Pipe({
  name: 'uppercase'
})
export class UppercasePipe implements PipeTransform {

  transform(input: string): any {
    return input.toUpperCase();
  }

}
```

To test, we are simply testing a class. Below is the setup and some sample tests:

```js
import { UppercasePipe } from './uppercase.pipe';

describe('UppercasePipe', () => {
  let pipe: UppercasePipe;

  beforeEach(() => {
    pipe = new UppercasePipe();
  });

  it('creates an instance', () => {
    expect(pipe).toBeTruthy();
  });

  it('transforms input string to uppercase', () => {
    expect(pipe.transform('angular rocks!')).toBe('ANGULAR ROCKS!');
  });
});
```

### Tasks
In these exercises, we are going to test-drive the implementation of the `ShortDatePipe`, which will transform an input ISO date string and return a "short date" format.

```
'1960-06-01T11:01:12.720Z' ----> '06/01/1960, 11:01am'
```

Complete the following tests:
  * `creates an instance`
  * `should not throw error`
  * `returned value should contain date format dd/mm/yyyy`
  * `returned value should contain time hh:mm[am|pm]`
  * `should convert ISO string to correct date format (am)`
  * `should convert ISO string to correct date format (pm)`

You can use this sample data:
  * `'1972-08-23T15:22:34.694Z' ----> '06/01/1960, 11:01am'`
  * `'1980-10-04T21:35:51.869Z' ----> '10/04/1980, 09:35pm'`

</details>

## Module 9: Testing Routed Components

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Code**: `src/app/hacker-detail`

Testing routed components is not much different than testing components with async services, the only difference is that instead of dealing with timers or Promises, most likely you'll be dealing with `Observables` since the router exposes certain `Observable` properties to read information from the current route.

Take for instance the `HackerDetailComponent`:

```js
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hacker-detail',
  templateUrl: './hacker-detail.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./hacker-detail.component.scss']
})
export class HackerDetailComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() id: string;
  hacker: Hacker;

  constructor(private api: ApiService, private route: ActivatedRoute) { }

  ngOnInit() {
    this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
      this.id = params['id'];
      this.renderDetails(this.id);
    });
  }

  renderDetails(id: string) {
    this.api.getHackerDetails(id)
      .then((data) => {
        this.hacker = data;
      });
  }

}
```

It has two injected dependencies, the `ApiService` and the `ActivatedRoute`. You know how to create a mock for the api service (simply return a resolved promise). However, the `params` property is an observable that emits an object. Here, we care about the `id` param, since our route was declared as `hackers/:id`.

At the beginning of the describe block, you can create mocks for both:

```js
const mockApiService = {
  getHackerDetails: (id) => Promise.resolve(mockHackers[3])
};

const mockActivatedRoute = {
  params: Observable.of({ id: 'f1b2e9bf-2794-4ccf-a869-9ddb93478f70'})
};
```

Using `Observable.of()` is a very convinient way of wrapping objects into an observable.

When configuring the `TestBed`, for the providers you instruct Angular to use these when the service dependencies are injected:

```js
providers: [
  { provide: ApiService, useValue: mockApiService },
  { provide: ActivatedRoute, useValue: mockActivatedRoute }
],
```

In your specs, calling `fixture.detectChanges()` will trigger `ngOnInit`, which will retrieve the id parameter, and then call `renderDetails`, which will then call the `getHackerDetails` method on the `api`. Lots of async here, so use `async()` along with `fixture.whenStable()`.

### Tasks:
Complete the following tests:
  * `should set the correct hacker name`
  * `should set the correct hacker status message`

## Module 10: Testing Workflows

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

There are specific things that as a developer and tester and you can do to create a better testing workflow. From terminal reporting, to commit hooks, you should take advantage of the tools available.

### Setup and Configuration

The Angular CLI generates a project for you with testing included out of the box. It's a good idea to generate code coverage reports when you run your tests:

```
ng test --single-run --codecoverage
```

Better yet, create an npm script for this:

```
"test": "ng test --single-run --code-coverage"
```

and also a script to watch your tests automatically:

```
"test:watch": "ng test --code-coverage"
```

Also, configure terminal reporting (refer to Module 2 above).

### Enforcing coverage thresholds

There are mixed opinions on whether or not you should enforce coverage thresholds. Sure, a codebase of 99% coverage may not necessarily mean that your code is bug free, but tested code is one major step in the way of producing clean code. Enforcing coverage thresholds will promote testability among your team (specially if your team is new to testing), and you can ensure that untested code is not making its way to your codebase.

Install the `karma-istanbul-threshold` module:

```
npm i karma-istanbul-threshold --save-dev
```

and add it to the plugins in `karma.conf.js`:

```js
plugins: [
  require('karma-jasmine'),
  require('karma-chrome-launcher'),
  require('karma-jasmine-html-reporter'),
  require('karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter'),
  require('karma-istanbul-threshold'),
  require('@angular/cli/plugins/karma'),
  require('karma-spec-reporter')
],
```

add the `'json'` reporter to the `coverageIstanbulReporter` object:

```js
coverageIstanbulReporter: {
  reports: [ 'html', 'lcovonly', 'json', 'text-summary' ],
  fixWebpackSourcePaths: true
},
```

add the `'istanbul-threshold'` reporter:

```js
reporters: config.angularCli && config.angularCli.codeCoverage
            ? ['spec', 'coverage-istanbul', 'istanbul-threshold']
            : ['spec', 'kjhtml'],
```

and finally, configure the thresholds:

```js
istanbulThresholdReporter: {
 src: 'coverage/coverage-final.json',
 reporters: ['text'],
 thresholds: {
   global: {
     statements: 90,
     branches: 65,
     lines: 90,
     functions: 90,
   },
   each: {
     statements: 80,
     branches: 60,
     lines: 60,
     functions: 80,
   },
 }
},
```

Now, if any of these stats fall below the specified thresholds, running `ng test` will fail, even if each spec is passing:

### Preventing bad commits

Husky can be used to easily configure git hooks to prevent bad commits. It's an npm module, so install it:

```
npm i --save-dev husky
```

Then, you can configure a `precommit` and `prepush` hook by simply adding npm scripts:

```js
"precommit": "npm run lint",
"prepush": "ng test --single-run --code-coverage"
```

Before committing, it will run the linter, and before pushing your branch, it will run the test suite. This combined with coverage thresholds can provide a powerful way of enforcing clean, tested code.

## Module 11: Continuous Integration (TravisCI and Codecov)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

You can use TravisCI to automatically test your code as it's pushed to GitHub, and configure it to run for every pull request.

Head over to [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) and sign in with your GitHub account. You can then "flick the repository" switch to "on" for your repo. The next step is to add a .travis.yml file.

```yml
dist: trusty
sudo: required
language: node_js
node_js:
  - '6'
addons:
  apt:
    packages:
      - google-chrome-beta
env:
  - CHROME_CANARY_BIN=/usr/bin/google-chrome-beta
before_script:
  - export DISPLAY=:99.0
  - sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start &
  - sleep 3
install:
  - npm install
  - npm install -g codecov
script:
  - npm test
  - codecov -f coverage/coverage-final.json
```

There is a a lot going on here. We are instructing TravisCI to use Ubuntu Trusty, Node 6.x, and further instructions to in order to get Chrome Canary headless running. In addition, we will be using [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/) in order to provide coverage reports for us. It works out of the box with TravisCI, simply sign up using your GitHub account.

Once you open a PR or push any branch, it will trigger a TravisCI build:

![travis ci building](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/travis-ci-building.png)

If the build fails, you will know both on GitHub and on TravisCI:

![travis ci failed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/travis-ci-failed-log.png)

Once fixed, repush your branch, and the build triggers again:

![travis ci passed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victormejia/fluent-angular-testing-workshop/master/screenshots/travis-ci-passed-gh.png)

In addition, since we have enabled reporting with Codecov, we get a codecov bot reporting the coverage:
